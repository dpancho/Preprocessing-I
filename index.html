        <h2>A Little About Me...</h2>
        <p>Before I decided to pursue a profession as a web developer, I studied tons on my own time. I was a stereo-typical 'nerd', like the movies! Being a video game professional as well in my teenage years, I refered to myself as 'game-a-teer' as a joke. I finally graduated high school and pursued my undergrad at Harvard Princeton of South Antartica. I graduated to of my class (#1/1 students). I used these connections to move to Silicon Valley and start Yelp and Google. I also gave the base programs to NASA to land on the moon</p>
